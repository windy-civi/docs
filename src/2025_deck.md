# **Govbot**

Federated, open-source legislative data for everyone

Setup + Core Functions

## The Problem

> Why don't we pay attention to our representatives between elections?

Legislative data is hard to parse, track, and organize. Activists, concerned citizens, and the curious may not have the time, resources, or expertise to build out duplicative tech stacks.

---

## The Problem (cont.)

Existing solutions may be limited by the willingness of organizations and companies to continue to run and host them - such as in the case of Google's Civic Information API, which was shut down earlier this year.

**What would a decentralized, open-source legislative data solution look like?**

---

## Our Solution

The Govbot team's goal is to bridge this gap - building the framework for federated, open-source, non-profit legislative data.

Built as a [Chi Hack Night](https://chihacknight.org) [Breakout Group](https://github.com/chihacknight/breakout-groups/issues/219), this project offers frameworks and tools built on top of OpenStates' data on state and federal legislation.

---

## What We Offer

The main Govbot dataset currently includes legislative updates from:
- the U.S. House & Senate
- Legislatures from all 50 states
- Legislatures from U.S. territories

Data is organized as .json files using the Project Open Data catalog format, scraped and appended regularly.

---

## Features

- A decentralized, regularly updating, legislative data catalog
- AI-powered, topic-based tagging and summaries, customized using .yml
- SQL querying via DuckDB interface
- Example applications, like custom websites (see our demo [WindyCivi](https://windycivi.com/) site), and social media bots (see our [BlueSky bot](https://bsky.app/profile/test-hoan-huynh.bsky.social), made in collaboration with U.S. Representative Hoan Huynh)

---

## Setup

You can download the setup script via one-line install, from our GitHub repository:
```
sh -c “$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/windy-civi/toolkit/main/actions/govbot/scripts/install-nightly.sh)
```

## Core Functions

Once installed, you can:
- Clone the entire dataset
- Clone specific items (state, session, or bill)
- Load metadata into a SQL-accessible DuckDB database

---

# **Project History**

---

## Project History

The Govbot project began in 2022 with a vision to create a destination for simplified, summarized updates on legislative action.

The initial Windy Civi app and website launched in beta in 2024.

---

## Our New Vision

The team began to consider the limitations of a centrally-managed data source versus one that could be:
- Decentralized
- Open-source
- Allowing exploration beyond initial designs

Our vision has now pivoted to building that data set, as well as sample applications to ensure government accountability is accessible to all.

## Basic Setup + Commands
Install via:
```
sh -c “$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/windy-civi/toolkit/main/actions/govbot/scripts/install-nightly.sh)
```
Once installed, you can download and set up the data using the following commands
```
govbot # to see help
govbot clone # to show available datasets
govbot clone {{locale}} {{locale}} # download specific items
govbot delete {{locale}} # delete specific items
govbot delete all # delete everything
govbot load # load bill metadata into DuckDB
```

---

## Querying with DuckDB

First, set up DuckDB, which creates a simulated database from the .json log files:

```
govbot load #Load all data into a database
govbot load –database my-bills.duckdb #Specify a custom database file
govbot load –memory-limit 32GB –threads 8 #With memory limit and thread settings

duckdb –ui govbot.duckdb #Open in DuckDB UI (opens in browser) 
```
Once the DuckDB database is created, you can query as normal
```
– Load JSON extension
INSTALL json;
LOAD json;
– Query all bill metadata
SELECT *
FROM read_json_auto(’~/.govbot/repos/**/bills/*/metadata.json’)
LIMIT 10;
```

## Contributing & Testing

### Prerequisites

Knowledge of Rust and the `just` task runner required.

1. **Rust & Cargo**: Install the [Rust Toolchain](https://rustup.rs/)
2. **Just**: Install the task runner: `cargo install just`

---

## Development Workflow

Use `just govbot ...` as your CLI "dev" environment.

**Useful Commands:**
- `just` - See all available tasks
- `just test` - Run all tests
- `just review` - Review snapshot test changes
- `just mocks [LOCALES...]` - Update mock data for testing

---

## Dataset Status Key

- 🆕 The locale's data received updates since your last cloning
- ✅ Your data is up-to-date with the most current version
- 🔄 The data is currently being updated
- ❌ The data is not currently accessible

## FAQs: Data Structure

**How Is The Data Structured?**

Find the file format structure and .json schema in the readme.md:
[DATA_STRUCTURES.md](https://github.com/windy-civi/toolkit/blob/main/actions/format/docs/DATA_STRUCTURES.md)

---

## FAQs: Cloning Data

**How Do I Clone This Data?**

Each locale is scraped using a GitHub Actions template explained here:
[README_TEMPLATE.md](https://github.com/windy-civi/toolkit/blob/main/actions/format/docs/for-caller-repos/README_TEMPLATE.md)

To manage multiple pipelines or locales, see our [pipeline manager documentation](https://github.com/windy-civi/toolkit/tree/main/actions/pipeline-manager)
